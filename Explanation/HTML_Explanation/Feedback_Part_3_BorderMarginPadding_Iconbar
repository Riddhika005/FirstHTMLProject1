I must say, I am impressed with your dedication. Wonderful quotes, Romantic + Inspiring. I belive now you are getting some positive energy. :) 

Feedbacks :

1. div2 and div3 both have common elements of font-size:23px;. In this scenario, the common elements should be on the base div and you should make child divs to inherit common elements and have other properties defined to that.

2. Start using Inheritance more rather than repeating same statement again and again.

3. There is something called css variables. Although its part of advance, but you should have asked me "How can I repeat same stuff again and again?". Let's say you have a font size 23 px that you want to use lot of times. Create a variable on root, and use it everywhere. Ref [https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_variables.asp] 

4. The entire page is not responsive. Make it responsive, when I trim it down, paragraph 1 and 2 gets crumbled on each other. Try to makeit non-overlaping. [Suggestion]. Quote 7 is ideal example of that. Bravo :)

5. Gallery portion is still not complete. [Pending from 2 weeks !!]. The properties what you have learned, you should now be able to create a gallery. Please give it a try with a smile :)

6. Remove the classes or files which are not in use or not started. It will keep the repo clean and also follow sub-folder structure. like next time when you gonna commit create a sub folder named "Part 4" and commit. Bujhli ?

7. Icon bar should be part of Navigation bar. It is lying like an orphan children :(

Rest, all looks good. Vishon vishon valo. Yes, I would now like to have a Black coffee. Please, madam coffee khawoaben ?:P
